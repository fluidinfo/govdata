Government Linked Metadata Search'o'Meter
=========================================

What..?
+++++++

A simple single page application for searching and displaying metadata from
http://data.gov and http://data.gov.uk (among other things).

Created for the purposes of demonstrating FluidDB as a platform for linked
data.

Where..?
++++++++

Within the project you'll find the following files:

* index.html - the markup for displaying the web-application
* style.css - defines the look of the web-application
* app.js - contains the application logic
* images/ - image files
* js/ - javascript files used by app.js (sammy.js and fluiddb.js)

How..?
++++++

I used a tool called flimp (FLuiddb IMPorter) to add the metadata from the
government sites. Flimp was also used to import this application into FluidDB
(yes, that's right, this application is both logic and data within FluidDB).
The application itself was built using simple HTML, CSS and Javascript over
the course of an afternoon (check the git log).
